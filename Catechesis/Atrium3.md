Our Level 3 Atrium at Church of Our Redeemer, Lexington, Massachusetts, is called the "Kingdom of God Atrium", though mostly by the kids. It is not an official name, yet. I see my main role as having the children fall in love with the Parousia, and accept their role in brining that about. We look forward to a time when:

* Everyone treats everyone the way they want to be treated
* Where everyone does good for those who hate them, even though that would mean that no one hates anyone anymore.
* When the knowledge of God and God's love for us covers the whole earth, and is in all people, and infuses the way that all people treat each other and treat the planet and all the creatures and plants here.

Pretty cool stuff.

We also work to deepen our knowledge and understanding of history and liturgy.

The album pages here are based on the group album prepared as part of the Level III training given by Joyce Scherer-Hoock in Melrose, Massachusetts, 2014-2015. The individual pages were prepared by combining Joyce's album pages with our class statements of doctrinal content, direct aims, and indirect aims. These statements were derived through discussion, though one classmate did the final work of refining the wording and adding them to the final album page. I do not have attributions to offer for that part of the work.
