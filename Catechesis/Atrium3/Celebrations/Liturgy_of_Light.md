## Subject: Celebrations

## Pre-requisites:

## Age: 3 & up

## Liturgical Time: As near as possible to Easter Vigil without anticipating it

## Sources:
* CGS Level I Course
* RPC pp. 116-117, 134
* BCP 284-295 or RC Sacramentary
* JJ pp. 74-75
* LYGWC p. 91

## Doctrinal Point:
* Christ has died, but Christ is raised!
* The light and life of the Risen Christ is available to us and is stringer than death
* This light is shared among us and is made available through us to the world.

## Direct Aim:
* Help children share in paschal mystery as they celebrate Christ rising
* To proclaim and celebrate the presence of the Risen Christ in and among us

## Indirect Aim:
* to enrich the child's awareness of and enjoyment of the gift of sharing in Christ's light
* to familiarize the children with the Easter liturgy
* To provide the context for celebration of the baptismal mystery.
* education to wonder, especially at the mystery of the continuing presence

## Materials:
* paschal candle with stand
* altar cloth
* low table
* individual candles
  * tea lights in glass votive holders
    * cheap, but effectively single use, which raises the net cost
  * votives in glass votive holders
    * unscented are available from religious supply shops
    * stores try to sell you scented, which would be overpowering
  * tapers, like those "candlelight service" candles with the cardstock wax guard
    * not appropriate for young children
    * the increase in difficulty makes this appropriate for older children, especially those who are already serving as acolytes
    * NOTE: all candles are placed together on a table, still lit, during the celebration
    * tray with deep sand can hold candles
    * lots of individual candle holders, sized for the candles being used also works
* matches, snuffer, spent match container
* Bible or lectionary
* statue of the Good Shepherd
* paschal candle cards
* flowers and vase
* chairs (safer while holding candles than sitting on the floor is)
* banners, if available

## Presentation:

* **Preparation**
  * In the week or weeks before:
    * speak of the great feast and its coming celebration.
    * Learn Easter songs.
    * Practice how to handle a candle.
    * Children should know or be introduce to the way to process.
  * On the day of the celebration:
    * have the children help in making preparation
      * set up chairs
      * make the new year's numbers for the paschal candle
      * choose and look up scripture
      * choose and practice songs
    * select a darkened location; this is where you will begin the procession
* **Gathering and introduction** - gather at some place apart from the site of celebration to explain briefly what will occur at the celebration. (This might be done at the last catechetical session, or on the day of the celebration)
  * let children know that the room will be dark
  * tell where to walk
  * give out items to be carried in procession
    * white cloth
    * basket of candles
    * Bible
    * Prayer card with Alleluia on it
    * Statue of Good Shepherd
    * flowers (children can carry individual flowers)

* **Blessing and preparation of paschal candle** - in dim light, show and briefly explain paschal candle. Pass out cards to children helping to light it. They say the words on the cards and trace the requisite symbol. If the child does not yet read, an adult may whisper them to that child, who can repeat them.

* **Light paschal candle** *May the light of Christ rising in glory dispel the darkness of our minds and hearts.*

* **Process**
  * with paschal candle leading the way, process to site of celebration. Elements for setting the table, sharing the light, and proclaiming the word may be included in the procession in the order in which thy will be used.
  * As you process in silence, the person holding the paschal candle can stop 3 times, raise the candle, and sing "The light of Christ" and the rest respond with "Thanks be to God".
  * place of celebration should be well thought our and decorated in an appropriate manner for the joyous celebration which will take place there. This might mean, among other things, special attention to flowers, banners, vesting of the space.

* **Prepare the table* - Table should be prepared with altar cloth, bible/lectionary, basket of candles with holders, GS statue, flowers

* **Light the candles** - Individual candles should be given to each child with words such as: "N., receive the light of Christ."
  * After gospel in another version of this celebration, preceded by this suggested prayer: "We celebrate that Christ is Risen and his Light and Life are stronger than death. We also celebrate that he came to share the Light and Life of the resurrection with us."

* Exsultet
  * children hold their candles as Exsultet is sung or said
  * at its conclusion, they put their candles, still lit, in holders (sand or some other method) ***Adult supervision is necessary during this transition***

* Proclamation
  * one or more passages from scripture may be proclaimed, depending on the age of the children.
  * children may select passages beforehand, again depending on age.
  * Suggested passages
    * Revelations 22:5 *And there will be no more night; they need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.*
    * Psalm 118: 27a *The LORD is God and has given us LIGHT.*
    * Rev. 21: 23-24 *And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb. The nations will walk by its light, and the Kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.*
    * Isaiah 60:1 *Arise, shine, for your light has come,
       and the glory of the LORD rises upon you.*
    * Ephesians 5: 8-10 *For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth) and find out what pleases the Lord.*
    * John 1: 4-5 *In him was life, and that life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.*
    * I John 1: 5 *This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all. *
    * Isaiah 60: 19 *The sun will no more be your light by day,
       nor will the brightness of the moon shine on you,
       for the LORD will be your everlasting light,
       and your God will be your glory.*
    * It would be appropriate to sing a hymn before proclaiming the gospel, as we do in church
    * Mark 16: 1-7 *When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdelene and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought spices so that they might go and anoint Jesus' body. And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun has risen they went to the tomb. They had been saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us, from the entrance to the tomb?" When they looked up they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled back. As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man, dressed in a white robe, sitting on the right side and they were alarmed. But he said to them, "Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him. But go tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you."*
    * Mt 28: 1-7   *After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.  His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.  The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men. The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.  He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."*
