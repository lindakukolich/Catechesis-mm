## Subject: Celebrations

## Pre-requisites: The Exodus readings that are part of the Exodus Typology materials.

## Age: 9 & up

## Liturgical Time: As near as possible to Passover and/or Maundy Thursday

## Sources:
* Chabad.org

## Doctrinal Point:
* The passover meal reflects our trust in God, that he loves us and has provided for us, freeing us from slavery, feeding us, and instructing us.

## Direct Aim:
* To experience a meal like one shared by Jesus and His disciples; a feast which is shared by all Jews every year; and reflected by the feast shared by all Christians today.

## Indirect Aim:
* Greater understanding of our Jewish neighbors
* The opportunity to see the something like the signs which are dear to us in the signs dear to our neighbors.

## Materials:
* Seder plate
* Wine Glasses, goblets
* Basin to wash hands
* Ewer of water to wash hands
* Towels to dry hands
* Haggadahs, one for each child
* 3 cloth napkins as matzoh covers. One can be beautifully embroidered.
* Food for the Seder:
  * Matzoh, at least two per person
  * Grape Juice - 4 small glasses for each person, so a bunch
  * Boiled eggs, at least one per person
  * Salt water, plus dishes to dip in
  * Lettuce and ground horseradish (bitter herbs)
  * A shankbone (must definitely be a bone, but the species is not that important, though not pork)
  * Charoset - a sticky mix, usually of honey and apples. Ask the internet for recipes. Chabad says: wine, ground nuts, apples and pears. Others also use ginger, figs, dates, pomegranates, cinnamon. I've heard of folks using honey. Sticky and a little lumpy seems to be the point.
  * A raw vegetable for Karpas: One of: Potato, radish, parsley, celery, onion. This could be nearly anything.

## Presentation:

* In the weeks before:
  * Read from Exodus, as set out for the Exodus typology, from the beginning through at least the giving of the law. This is Bible study for several weeks.
  * speak of this feast which is still shared by Jews around the world
  * Plan the Seder, including who will bring which foods for the Seder plate, plates and napkins and wine glasses. Readings will be assigned on the day.
  * Have children assemble Haggadah out of available choices, because there are optional additional parts
* On the day of the celebration:
  * have the children help in making preparation
    * set table in center of floor, no chairs
    * Assemble the Seder plate
    * Prepare the hand washing station
    * Make sure there are enough Haggadahs (text follows) for everyone.
  * Follow the service as described in the Haggadah
  * After the service, restore the Atrium to order

## Work of the Child:
* Keep the Seder plate in the Atrium for the remainder of the year, to be available for remembrance and reflection

## Observations and Reflections:

## Our Haggadah

This is mostly based on the Seder as described on chabad.org, with a bunch of deletions.

### Preparation

- A low table, in the middle of the room. No chairs. We are "reclining" while we eat this meal, like wealthy ancient people.
- A Seder Plate, as described below
- One or more basins on the side of the room, with a handled cup or a pitcher of water to wash our hands with.

_The Seder Plate_

The ingredients and order of placement

- matzah

This goes under the plate. Layer a plate, a napkin, 3 matzah, and another napkin or nicely embroidered cover cloth.

The matzah reminds us that the people of Israel had to leave Egypt so quickly they could not wait for their bread to rise.

- the Seder Plate

The special foods we eat on Passover are also food for thought. Every item on the Seder plate abounds in meaning and allusion.

- Zeroa The Shank bone

The bone from a piece of roasted meat represents the lamb that was the special Passover offering.

- Beitzah - a hard-boiled egg, representing the festival offering.

- Maror - grated horseradish and romain lettuce, for use as bitter herbs

- Charoset - a paste made of fruit, nuts, and wine. We dip the bitter herbs in this

- Karpas - a bit of vegetable

- Chazeret - more bitter herbs, for use in the matzah-maror sandwich

- Beside the plate, or participant is a wine glass and plenty of wine (4 cups for each person) and a dish of salt water


### The parts of the Seder

Chabad lists out 15 parts that they feel are necessary. My Jewish friends think the list of essentials is a little smaller, but this is close to right. Eventually, this document will by the Haggadah for my Level III atrium.

- Plain text is read by the leader for this section. We will probably take turns being lead.
- **Bold text** is recited by all of us, together
- *Italic text* is an action that we all do together, or is done by the current leader

1. Kadesh - Sanctify

We bless and drink a glass of wine together, to bring ourselves into this sacred time.

**Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who creates the fruit of the vine.**

**Blessed are You, G-d, our G-d, King of the universe, who has chosen us from among all people, and raised us above all tongues, and made us holy through His commandments. And You, G-d, our G-d, have given us in love festivals for happiness, feasts and festive seasons for rejoicing the day of this Feast of Matzot and this Festival of holy convocation, the Season of our Freedom, a holy convocation, commemorating the departure from Egypt. For You have chosen us and sanctified us from all the nations, and You have given us as a heritage Your holy Festivals in happiness and joy. Blessed are You, G-d, who sanctifies Israel and the festive seasons.**

**Blessed are You, G-d, our G-d, King of the universe, who has granted us life, sustained us, and enabled us to reach this occasion.**

*We drink one glass of wine*

2. Urchatz - Cleanse

We wash our hands to make them clean before we do the work of handling food. We can also think about making our hearts clean as we begin this celebration.

*We leave the table to go to our handwashing station. We wash our hands, pouring water over them and letting the water fall in a dish. We dry our hands. We return to the table.*

3. Karpas - Appetizer

The Karpas reminds us of the hard labor of the Jewish slaves, and the saltwater reminds us of their tears.

**Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who creates the fruit of the earth.**

*We all eat a small piece of vegetable, dipped in salt water.*

4. Yachatz - Break

Leader *Take hold of the middle of the 3 matzahs on your Seder plate. Break it in two and leave the smaller half between the other two whole matzahs. Take the larger piece and break it into 5 smaller pieces, wrapped in a cloth. Hide the package, which we will need at the end of our meal.*

5. Maggid - Tell

*Fill a second cup of wine. We will drink it when the story is done.*

The 4 questions:

What makes this night different from all other nights? *Make these comments in turn, starting with the youngest person present.*

- On all nights we need not dip even once, on this night we do so twice!
- On all nights we eat chametz (leavened bread) and matzah (unleavened bread), and on this night only matzah.
- On all nights we eat any kind of vegetables, and on this night maror!
- On all nights we eat sitting upright, and on this night we all recline!

We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and the L-rd, our G-d, took us out from there with a strong ha and with an outstretched arm. If G-d had not taken our fathers out of Egypt, we would remain there, enslaved to Pharaoh. Even if all of us were wise, all of us understanding, all of us knowing the Torah, we would still need to discuss the exodus from Egypt; and everyone who discusses the exodus from Egypt at length is praiseworthy.

What do we know about Moses, God's signs and wonders, the plagues and the splitting of the sea? What do we know about the care God took for us in the desert, and the care He has shown us by giving us the Sabbath and the Torah, and by bringing us to the Land of Israel?

*Discuss together what we know of the exodus. This can go all the way back to Abraham if we want it to, through Joseph and his brothers, and the readings we have done together this year.*

*When we are done, bless the second cup of wine*
**Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who creates the fruit of the vine.**
*Drink the second cup of wine.*

6. Rachtzah - Wash (again, this time with a blessing)

*Get up and return to the hand washing basin*

**Blessed are You, L-rd our G-d, King of the World, Who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us concerning the washing of the hands**

*Dry your hands and return to the table*

7. Motzie - Bread

Matzah, this unleavened bread, is the most important item in the Seder, and eating it fulfills the central mitzvah of Passover.

Leader: *Lift all three matzahs a little bit off the table, being careful not to break them, and say the blessing* Blessed be You, L-rd our G-d, King of the World, Who brings bread out of the earth.

*Keep holding the bread and keep being the leader for the next section*

8. Matzah

Leader: *Carefully release the bottom matzah from the stack and keep hold of the other two pieces* Blessed be You, L-rd our G-d, King of the World, Who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us concerning eating matzah.

Leader: *Break off a piece of each of the two matzos for yourself and everyone at the table. Pass them around*

Everyone: *Eat your matzah.*

9. Maror - Bitter

The bitter herbs remind us of the bitterness of our time in Egypt. The stickiness of the Charoset reminds us of the mortar we used to build with the bricks we made in Egypt. The sweetness of the Charoset reminds us that we did not stay in slavery. We went to freedom.

All: *Take a piece of the bitter herb, the lettuce and possibly the horseradish. Dip it in the Charoset.*

**Blessed Be You, L-rd our G-d, King of the World, Who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us concerning eating bitter herbs.**

*Eat the bitter herbs and charoset*

10. Korech - Wrap

Everyone: *Break off two pieces from the bottom matzah (using more from the box if necessary). Make a sandwich of matzah and bitter herb (this is why we had two servings on the plate). Dip it in the Charoset. Eat your sandwich.*

11. Shulchan Orech - Set the table

Now we eat our meal, starting with our hard-boiled egg dipped in salt-water. The egg is a sign of mourning, as we remember the destruction of the Temple and Jerusalem.

12. Tzafun - Hidden

*Retrieve and eat the hidden matzah.*

With the first matzah, we fulfilled our obligation to eat matzah. With this one, we remember the paschal lamb that is meant to be eaten on a full stomach.

13. Beirach - Bless

*Pour the third cup of wine and say the Grace after meals*

**Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who, in His goodness, feeds the whole world with grace, with kindness and with mercy. He gives food to all flesh, for His kindness is everlasting. Through His great goodness to us continuously we do not lack feed, and may we never lack it, for the sake of His great Name. For He is a benevolent G-d who feeds and sustains all, does good to all, and prepares food for all His creatures whom He has created, as it is said: You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing. Blessed are You L-rd, who provides food for all.**

**Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who creates the fruit of the vine.**

14. Hallel - Praise

*Pour another cup of wine for everyone.*

Everyone: Sing a song of praise together.

**Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who creates the fruit of the vine.**

Blessed are You, L-rd our G‑d, King of the universe for the vine and the fruit of the vine, for the produce of the field, and for the precious, good and spacious land which You have favored to give as an heritage to our fathers, to eat of its fruit and be satiated by its goodness. Have mercy, L-rd our G‑d, on Israel Your people, on Jerusalem Your city, on Zion the abode of Your glory, on Your altar and on Your Temple. Rebuild Jerusalem, the holy city, speedily in our days, and bring us up into it, and make us rejoice in it, and we will bless You in holiness and purity (On Shabbat add: May it please You to strengthen us on this Shabbat day) and remember us for good on this day of the Festival of Matzot. For You, L-rd, are good and do good to all, and we thank You for the land and for the fruit of the vine. Blessed are You, L-rd, for the land and for the fruit of the vine.

15. Nirtzah - Accepted

We are finished our Seder, and we are looking forward to a time when people from the whole world can all enjoy this meal together.

**Next year in Jerusalem!**
