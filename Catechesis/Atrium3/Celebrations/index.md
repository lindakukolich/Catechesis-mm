In some Catechesis parishes, the Level III children help run the celebrations for the Level II and I children. At our church, adults run the celebrations for the little kids and the Level III kids do something else that day. I would like to move closer to the model in other parishes by first giving the Level III children the experience of having their own celebrations, which they can then offer to the Level I and II children in the future.

So. This directory will hold the album pages for the Level I and II celebrations, with suggestions for how to include the older children as leaders. There are also album pages for celebrations that are done only in our Level III atrium.
