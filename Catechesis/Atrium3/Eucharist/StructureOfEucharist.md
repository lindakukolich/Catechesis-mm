Presentations about Eucharist in Levels I and II

## Sources:

* Course Notes (Joyce Scherer-Hoock, Melrose MA, 11/21/14)
* Book of Common Prayer pp. 859-860
* Catholic Catechism, Articles 2 & 3
* 1 Peter 2:2-10
* Album page prepared by Naomi Grey, revised 5/2014 - 11/2015

## Doctrinal Point:

The Eucharist is one great prayer of thanksgiving and praise made up of the work of the people together with the celebration of the Word.

## Direct Aim:

To participate more fully in the liturgy by identifying the parts of the liturgy in words and in actions, when they occur and what meanings and connections they have as part of a cosmic communion

## Indirect Aim:

* To learn the names of the elements of the Eucharist, such as Liturgy of the Word, Liturgy of the Table, Communion of the People, the Prayers, and the Ordinary.
* To consider the parts of the Liturgy through a visual representation

## Materials:

* Chart with Colored rectangles representing section of the Eucharist
* Box with wooden dominoes colored to correspond with the chart. Some dominoes have a graphic on them to represent important moments in the celebration.
* A copy of your church's worship leaflet
* Individual copies of the BCP

## Presentation:

* Recall "The Synthesis of the Eucharist", or review recently completed work on the Eucharist. **What meant the most to you?** *mingling of the water and wine, Holy Spirit comes to the table, remembrance of Jesus in the cenacle with his disciples*
* Show chart to the students. **What do you notice about it?**
* This chart will help us look deeper into the structure of the Holy Eucharist. **You may not have though of it this way, but the Eucharist is one great prayer we all join in.** It is one great prayer made up of many prayers.
* Let us recall a bit about prayer. **What is prayer** What kind of prayers are there? (See BCP page 586) *petition, adoration, thanksgiving, praise, confession*
* **The Holy Eucharist is a prayer. I wonder what kind of prayer it is?** *Eucharist means thanksgiving. It is right to give God thanks and praise, BCP 361*
* **There are almost 50 prayers within this one great prayer** *Have students count them as you point to the blank squares on the chart.*
  * **Do you see how this is organized by color?** *Green, Yellow, Orange, Gray*
  * **Let's try to discover what these colors stand for**
* Introduce the two parts of the Liturgy
  * **The Word of God** BCP 355, sometimes called the Liturgy of the Word
  * **The Holy Communion**, BCP 361 also called the Liturgy of the Table
  * Find these headings in the service leaflet
* Differentiate the color coding
  * On our chart the Liturgy of the Word is colored Green
    * It includes 4 Bible readings. 3 are read at the lectern. Can you remember where the 4th is read? *Center of aisle* I wonder why it is read from that location.
    * On our chart, the Liturgy of the Table or The Holy Communion includes
      * The Offertory or Preparation of the Gifts in Yellow
      * The Eucharistic Prayer in Orange
      * The Communion in Grey
* The White rectangles are for prayers that change every week or every season. The Colored dominoes are prayers that stay the same.
* Let's try to place the colored rectangles on the chart and identify which prayer or action in the BCP or service leaflet they correspond to. *You will need to read the small print that gives directions, as well as the main text for things people say*
* You might divide the group into teams, one for each color, to work out which rectangles correspond to the BCP text. The chart is not needed for this so much for the Yellow and Grey sections, so they can work on the side and transfer their work at the end.
* Gather together at the end and have each group walk through, explaining their choices together. Expect some overlap and ambiguity. Don't let it trouble you or the students. Encourage the group to discuss and work together over the unclear parts. Ask open-ended questions to help them process.
* **Now let us hear a scripture passage that talks about our role in the Eucharist**  Light candle and read **1 Peter 2: 4-5, 9-10**
  * As you come to him, the living Stone, rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him -- you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
  * But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God'a special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.

## Invite response in prayer or song:
