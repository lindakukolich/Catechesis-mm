There are five Typologies in the Level III Atrium. They take readings from the Torah, either from Genesis or Exodus, link them to Christ using the Liturgy as our guide, and show how they point to the completion of God's Plan in Parousia.

To work with the typologies, we first do the readings as Bible study. In the case of the Abraham and Moses readings, there are also supplementary materials about the history of Jewish worship and the people of Israel that are presented and worked with. When the children have enough familiarity with the readings and their context, we present the Typology. This is a process of handing out and discussing cards and placing them on a time line. Finally, we reflect on this process going from our initial understanding of God, our opening to God through Christ, and the completion of this process when God answers our prayer "Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven".

In our congregation, we have two classrooms with three year programs, and three classrooms with two year programs. My Level III Atrium is in the gap between them, so I have children for either two or three years. In the "two year" years, I have what will be the next Rite 13 cohort (the classroom following mine). During those years, we offer the [Solemn Celebration of the Eucharist](../SolemnCelebration), a series of lessons often used for preparation for first communion and the rite of reconciliation (confession). The Creation, Sin typologies are offered as preparation for the Solemn Celebration readings.  The Flood and Abraham are offered in the same year, and Exodus is so long it is the only typology that year. This way, some kids (the older year in the two year blocks) get all five typologies, and other kids get either 3 or 4 of them.

* [Creation](Creation)
  * We introduce two stories of creation and look at the role of humans in each.
* [Sin](Sin)
  * We look at how humans introduced sin in the world, and how God has responded.
* [Flood](Flood)
  * We look at the destruction of the old world and God's recreation of it in the Flood, and the new creation that is the world as it will become.
* [Abraham](Abraham)
  * We look at Abraham and his travels, at worship in the ancient world. We connect Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac, and God's mercy in providing a ram to offer instead, with Christ's willingness to be our sacrifice.
* [Exodus](Exodus)
  * We look at the History of Israel, the objects used in worship in the temple, the 10 commandments, and we have a Seder-like meal. We look at how that yearly Seder is connected to our weekly celebration of the Eucharist.
