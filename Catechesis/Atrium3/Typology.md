There are five Typologies in the Level III Atrium. They take readings from the Torah, either from Genesis or Exodus, link them to Christ using the Liturgy as our guide, and show how they point to the completion of God's Plan in Parousia.

To work with the typologies, we first do the readings as Bible study. In the case of the Abraham and Moses readings, there are also supplementary materials about the history of Jewish worship and the people of Israel that are presented and worked with. When the children have enough familiarity with the readings and their context, we present the Typology. This is a process of handing out and discussing cards and placing them on a time line. Finally, we reflect on this process going from our initial understanding of God, our opening to God through Christ, and the completion of this process when God answers our prayer "Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven".
