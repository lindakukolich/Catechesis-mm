*Level III, Melrose MA, 2014-2015 Formation Leader: Joyce Scherer-Hoock*
**Section:** Typology

**Age:** 9+

**Sources**

* Class notes
* _History's Golden Thread_ - chapters 9-11
* Genesis 1:1 - 2:25

**Liturgical Time**: none specific, complete study takes 3-4 weeks.

**Pre-requisites:** none

**Doctrinal Content**

* God is good and the source of all good.  God, though complete and needing nothing, nonetheless created the world out of love and a desire for relationship.  
* All that God created is good.  
* God gives humanity created in God’s image a share in God’s own life, choice, free will, and the ability to be a partner in the working out of God’s plan.  

**Direct Aim**

* To ponder the two creation stories and to identify and explore the signs of creation.
* To identify that there is a golden thread running through history connecting God’s plan through all times, from Creation, through Redemption, to Parousia.
* To identify/explore the meaning of the signs of Creation

**Indirect Aims**

* To compare and contrast the two accounts of creation.
* Increased participation in the liturgy.  Greater ability to appreciate Bible study.  
* To introduce the idea of myth as a story with larger ramifications.
* To get some understanding of the cosmology of the ancient near east.
* To connect the liturgy of baptism with the waters of creation.
* To prepare for the lessons extending to Redemption and Parousia.

**Materials**

* Bible for each child
* Candle, matches, snuffer
* Chart paper and marker
* Creation Typology timeline and cards

**Presentation**

**First Sitting**

1.	Prepare the children — Explain how stories are easier to remember, so people use stories to give a message. A very important story is called a myth. Ask children if they know any American myths. *See below for alternative introductions*
2.	Introduce the text — Announce that there are two stories of Creation written to answer the questions, “Who created the earth?” “Is creation good or bad?” “What is the purpose of creation?” “What is the role of the people?”
3.	Light the candle. Read Genesis 1:1 - 2:3. Pause after each day is described and ask children what was created. List on chart paper.
4.	Discuss the above questions. Ask “How is God presented?” *(Powerful, transcendent)*
5.	Extinguish the candle. Put materials away.

**Second Sitting**

1.	Review the first account of creation. Ask “What do you remember about the Story of Creation from last week?”
2.	Light the candle. Read Genesis 2:4 — 2:25. Pause several times to list what was created.
3.	Review the above questions. Ask “Are the answers to the questions similar?” Explore the way the two accounts are different or similar.

**Third Sitting** (can be combined with second sitting)

1.	Ask, “Name the important signs, people, places that are mentioned in the accounts of creation. List in another column.
2.	Ask, “Do these things have some meaning?” [Be sure to focus on process, not product.] List in second column. (For example, The Garden of Eden might be symbolic of God’s providence.)
3.	Present the time line base and cards. Announce that the church has taken some of these signs and used them in its prayers or liturgy. Unfold the gray base. Distribute the picture cards and arrange on the timeline. Distribute text squares, have a child read and place each under the picture.

**Work of the Child:**
1.	Place cards on timeline as in the presentation
2.	Illustrate/ make model of the two accounts of creation.
3.	Illustrate/ make model of each of the signs.


**Alternative ways to introduce this lesson:**

1. Enter into a conversation with the children about their questions. Do they every wonder,  Who am I?  How did I get here? Where did I come from?  What is the meaning of things? Hebrew people also asked these questions. Could also talk about how a story or anecdote functions in a sermon or talk.

2. Recall the Blue Strip.  At some point the first human creatures looked around them saw so much beauty. They asked, “Who prepared this for us? The answer was God. God created all we see.” But was anyone present when the world was a created? Did anyone see it made? No. A myth is a story that tells a truth, not like a newspaper story tells the truth, but still a truth.

**Notes**

2016 - I had the kids draw a cartoon of either the first or second story of creation. They seemed to like that and had better retention of details because of their focus in making their art. The timeline was a bit of a bust, though the Sin typology went better, later, because we had worked with the Creation one.
