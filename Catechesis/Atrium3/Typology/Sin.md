## Doctrinal Content

* Man and woman lived in harmony with God, each other, and the earth.  
* The Man and the Woman were given the freedom to choose whether or not to live in obedience to God’s plan of love.  
* Although God and all of God’s creation is good, the man and the woman chose to disobey God rather than trust in his plan of goodness.
* Because of this sin, all creation became corrupted, and as a consequence our world is in darkness, at war, subject to sickness and death.  
* Work has become a labor rather than a delight.  God’s plan for the fruitfulness of all creation is now subject to suffering.
* Because of his love and mercy he clothed mankind and blocked access to the Tree of Life.  

## Direct Aims

* To explore the biblical account of the Fall as an explanation of the existence of evil in the world.
* To explore the questions of Who is responsible for Evil? What are the consequences of Evil? What is God’s response to Evil?

## Indirect Aim

* To explore the Golden Thread that leads from the clothing of the man and woman to our baptismal garment;
* to develop Bible study skills;
* To develop additional moral formation;
* To prepare for examination of conscience and reconciliation;

## Materials Checklist

* Bible for each child
* Candle, matches, snuffer
* Flip chart / markers or white board / markers
* Typology Time Line with picture and text cards as in the Materials Manual

## Presentation
*(1-2 weeks)*

### Introduction

* Recall what a myth is (story that has another meaning)
* Myths are about big, important questions ... This myth, found in the Bible, is about Evil
* This myth came from people that knew God was good. They were in covenant with God. However in their world there was a lot of Sin and Evil
* They had questions ... Who was responsible for  Sin/Evil? What are the consequences of Sin? What does God think of sin or do about Sin/Evil? What is God’s  response?

### The reading

* Light Candle
* Read using Bible study method where each person takes a turn reading a verse or paragraph (depends on group)

* Pause during reading to clarify and reflect

* Introduce serpent, what does it say about the serpent?, Does the woman physically die?

* They heard God walking ... what did they do?, Why?, How did they know it wasn’t the right thing to do? (knew from the tree of knowledge that they did wrong).
How can we describe the change before and after their eating the fruit? (more self conscious now) which is more like humankind ... before or alter? (after)

* Everyone is blaming everyone (very human situation) ... Who is responsible?

* What does the serpent represent? ... Do we have times of being tempted? ... Do we have times we don’t follow God’s command?

### Reflection

* Reflect after completion of Genesis 3 reading
* God threatened with death, but introduced death in a different way- not immediate -. God still helps with “garments”
* Can contrast: animals- no eternal life, no conscious good and evil; humans - no eternal life, conscious of good and evil; God-Eternal Life

(May break here for l week)

### Signs

* Name important signs / places / people in the scripture account of the Fall (specific, not big categories ie. not God) ... List these signs in a left column on board (this is not a “fixed” list)
* Consider the meaning that the signs have. List in second column (to the right of the first column) — Focus on Process, not product
* Reflect:
  * Who is responsible for Sin?
  * What are the consequences of Sin?
  * What is God’s response? ... How does God feel about this?
* Announce that the church has recognized the importance of some of these signs and incorporates them into liturgy / readings
* Present Sin Typology Time Line
* Lay out the two picture cards.
* Have children read and place the text cards that correspond to the picture cards. Read and discuss. Place additional cards, Read and discuss.



## Children’s Work:

* Illustrate or make dioramas of the Scripture account of the Fall/Sin
* Illustrate each of the signs
* Look up and read Scriptures texts found on the cards
* Illustrate other signs that were discussed during the bible study
* Select one word from the reading and reflect on it while you either illuminate it, or make a drawing of it.

## Response of the Child:

**Notes:**

2016: We did the reading by assigning roles, so each child read a part, narrator, God, Adam, Eve, serpent. There was a little teasing about "Adam" and "Eve" being married. They also had the sarcastic response of "Sorry Dad" as an insincere apology. That was a little off topic, but has become a short hand in the group that lets them identify insincerity in later work, so well done again Holy Spirit...
