## Presentation:

* **Introduction**
  * During these past weeks we have looked at some new ways of thinking of Jesus. What might they be? *True vine. Shepherd finding the sheep. Woman finding the coin.*
  * Let’s take a few minutes to **recall** our thoughts on Reconciliation & Eucharist.
  * **What does the True Vine have to do with Eucharist?** *Eucharist feeds us like the sap feeds the branches on the vine. Eucharist is about communion- connection. Connection is stronger without blocks*
  * Think also about the **Found Coin/ Found Sheep.** What is the connection with Reconciliation? *Eucharist is the celebration of being found.*
  * We have **another parable** today, to help us better understand how much God loves us. It also helps us understand why we are preparing to deepen our participation in Eucharist.
* **Summarize the story**
  * Two sons and the father. The younger son asks for his part of the estate his inheritance, even though his father was still alive. Let’s listen to the parable. Let’s listen to the choices the younger son made and also what the father does.
* **Light 4 candles and read Scripture: Luke 15: 11- 24**
* **Wondering about the story**
  * When the **son asks** for his part of the estate what does the father do?
  * Then what happens?
  * What kind of attitude does it seem the son might have?
  * Do you know what a **famine** is?
  * What does the son have left? *Nothing- he is caring for the pigs and doesn’t even get to eat their food.*
  * What was the difference between being a servant and a son? *Stronger bond between a father and a son.*
  * Did the son’s action strain this bond? Was he in any shape to ask for more? *No, he had shamed himself.*
  * But he made a **plan to go back**.  What attitude does he have now? *His plan was to return as a servant. He came back with a plea to be a servant outlined.*
  * But then what happened? *Something surprising. His father could have been mad at him. Everybody could have forgotten about him. But instead his Father ran to greet him.*
  * Would you normally notice someone a long way off? *No. Not unless you were looking for them.*
  * **The Father was waiting** and looking. Did the son expect this?
  * **Gifts** were given to the son who returned. What were they?
  * Why does the father give these gifts? *(To celebrate that the son who was as good as dead was really alive.)*
  * We hear that the father calls to put on a party when the son comes home.  I wonder why the father wants others to join this celebration. Where do we find this in our experience of reconciliation?
* **Wondering about its meaning**
  * Jesus told us this parable to help us understand God’s love. **What does it tell us about God’s love?** (That it is incredible, profligate, and generous beyond belief.)
  * The Father is? The Son is? What did the son need to do to understand the Father’s love?
  * Let’s think about the **gifts God has given us**. These gifts are our inheritance.
    * What about our family? Are they a gift?
    * What about others who help us?  Teachers, doctors, friends. Are they gifts?
    * We can also think about some of the gifts of creation- list with children. *Will be long.*
    * Could we ever think of all the gifts that are the inheritance of being alive in the world?
  * Have we always appreciated these gifts?
    * Those who love us?
    * The beauty of the world?
    * How do we miss appreciating these as gifts? What kind of attitude do we have about all we have been given?
  * After the Son had wasted his inheritance he did not have many choices did he? He was left feeding pigs. He was no longer free. Could we say that when we don’t enjoy our wonderful gifts we are no longer free?
* **Connection to liturgy**
  * Who would like to make the gesture that happens at reconciliation? *(Hint: asks for The Holy Spirit.)*
  * Show gesture of epiclesis
  * Here are the words that go with this gesture: **“I absolve you from all your sins.”**
  * I wonder what absolve might mean? Might it mean free from?
  * When we are free from our blocks, we are free for what? *Rejoicing. Bearing fruit. Life with God and others.*

## Invite response in prayer or song:

*We Are Marching in the Light of God.*
