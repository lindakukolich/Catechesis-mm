**PRESENTATION:** - Parable Version

* Gather the children.
* Introduction: Today we are going to think about one of the many stories Jesus told. Jesus told many stories. Do you recall what kind of stories they were? *Called parables. Recall some of the other parables.*
*	This parable has a coin in it that belongs to a woman. To be a woman and to have any coins would be unusual because the men took care of the money. But this woman had 10 coins. She probably wore the coins as part of her jewelry. They might have been given to her as a wedding present. They might have been worn on a chain like a necklace or around her head.  Very valuable.
*	People of that time lived in houses that were different from ours. Houses were very simple. Most people’s floors would have been made of dirt, or maybe stone or brick if wealthy. Have you ever noticed what a brink sidewalk is like? Bumpy. Sometimes things get caught between bricks. Would it be easy to find something on a brick walk or floor? No.
*	Let’s see what happens in this story.
*	***Light Candle & Read Scripture***
* Wonder
	  * What happened in this parable?
	  * I wonder, “Does everything get lost in the same way?”
    * Did the coin decide to be lost?
	  * How did the woman look for the coin? Unpack the word “diligent” from Scripture
    * What did the woman do when she found the coin?
    * Why?

**Found Coin as a communion Preparation Mediation:**

**Materials:**

* Table with beautiful vine on it.
* Candles to represent the number of meditation being done
* Booklets for Found Coin and Found Sheep

**Presentation**

* Introduction
  *	Recall True Vine
  *	Recall vinedresser. Who is this?
  *	Last week we talked about blocks in the flow of the sap. Today we will look at another parable. This will help us understand forgiveness and God’s mercy. This is a parable is about a woman who lost a very valuable coin.
  * In Jesus time, there was no paper money. There were only coins. Some coins could be worth as much as a person could earn in a whole year.
* Reading Scripture - Found Coin
  * Let’s listen to Scripture (Light 3 candles) Read Luke 15: 8-10
  *	**Diligent search** - explore meaning. She lifts a lamp & sweeps the house. Houses had brick or stone floor- hard to look for a small, lost item.
  *	When she did find it she called friends & neighbors. Why? *She wanted to celebrate. When we have good news we want to share it.*
  *	Who could this woman be?
  *	Who might the coin be?
* Reading Scripture - Found Sheep
  *	This parable can remind us of another parable. Can you think of which one? ***The found sheep.***
  * Invite a child to read Luke 15: 4-6.
  * How is the found sheep like the found coin? *Diligent search. Rejoicing- calling people together.*
* Reflect on Reconciliation
  *	Think for a minute about the Sacrament of Reconciliation. What is the moment of Reconciliation in the parable/ the moment of finding? *Celebration.*
  *	The joy of finding is whose joy?
  * We can think about the Sacrament of Reconciliation as a celebration of joy.
  * Lets take a moment to think about this gift of love and joy for us.
  *	How do we receive this?
* Examination of Conscience as awareness of blocks in flow of love between me and others
  * Part of Reconciliation is looking inside ourselves, an examination of conscience.
  * Think about the example in the parables of the desire of the vinedresser, woman, and shepherd.
  * Ask yourself, how do I enjoy this love? How much do I remain in God’s love? How much do I welcome God’s love and presence?
	* Think of the love given to me through others. Do I welcome and enjoy and remain in that love?  How well do I love those who love me in return?
	* How about my love for those who do not love me?
  * If we think about that sap flowing through the vine- love- flowing... when I fail to enjoy that love that the sap flow is blocked or there is a gap.
  * Blocks or gaps are things we can identify and the things we bring and tell the priest during the sacrament of reconciliation. During the sacrament of reconciliation the vinedresser has a remedy.
* There are two gestures the priest uses to show the gift from the vinedresser.
* Show gesture of Epiclesis
*  What did you see? What does this gesture say? Asks the Holy Spirit to fill, to flow in. In Reconciliation this gesture is done over a person. Saying, "Fill this person with the Holy Spirit." “Let love flow into them.”
* There is another gesture.
* Make large sign of the cross. I wonder why this gesture is used during reconciliation?
* Recall from our baptism the large sign of the cross is like a shield, a protection. What does this say about the vinedresser during the sacrament of Reconciliation?

* Think for a moment about the beautiful joyous when we celebrate reconciliation. Think of other names we could give this gift. Celebration of forgiveness, joy, 2nd chance
Pause and Enjoy
