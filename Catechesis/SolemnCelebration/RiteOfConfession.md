## Rite of Reconciliation
### INDIVIDUAL & CORPORATE CONFESSION

**SUBJECT:** First Communion/ Reconciliation

**TITLE:* Rite of Confession (Individual & Corporate Reconciliation)

**AGE:** 6 plus

**LITURGICAL TIME:** Anytime, Lent is especially appropriate; as preparation for an experience of reconciliation; before Solemn Celebration of Eucharist or first Eucharist.

**SOURCES:** Notes, Material Manual, BCP pp. 304, 360, 447
MATERIALS: Two sets of cards: one set for individual reconciliation, one set for corporate reconciliation each set consists of: 4 picture cards, 4 brief text cards, 4 label cards; 4 full text cards, a set of symbols for each- hand and sign of the cross: control chart for each set
DOCTRINAL POINT: In Christ we are freed from sin and set on the path of renewed life.
DIRECT AIM: to lift up the two primary sacramental paths available through the church, which can help us know and live Christ’s forgiveness
To give the children the means to keep the promise made in baptism, “Will you preserve in resisting evil and when you fall into sin, repent and return to the Lord?”
INDIRECT AIM: preparation for special celebrations of Holy Communion
greater participation in the liturgy
Practice sequencing
Give deeper exposure to the spiritual resources of the BCP and the Anglican/catholic faith.
PRESENTATION: Intro.: Recall the True Vine, blocks as sin, the idea of removal of the blocks, The Vinedresser has given us a way to remove the block we call sin. It is called Reconciliation. You might also introduce with a general discussion of how we make-up with people when we have wronged them.
Hand cards out the children in this sequence, one card at a time. 1) Picture cards 2) Short descriptions. 3) Title labels, 4) Full descriptions .No sequence at this point
 (Note: I prefer to introduce Corporate Confession before individual, as the children are more familiar with it.)
