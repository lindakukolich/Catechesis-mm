## Sacramental Preparation

*From A Catechesis of the Good Shepherd Level II Formation Course Handout*

### Preparation within the Atrium

In the 3-6 Atrium - The Gift

* The Good Shepherd
* Eucharistic Presence of the Good Shepherd
* The Found Sheep
* The Cenacle
* The Gifts of Baptism
* The Altar
* The Gestures of the Eucharist

In the 6-9 Atrium - The Response to the Gift (Living in Covenant)

* The Fettuccia
* The Synthesis of the Eucharist
* The Moral Parables
* The Mystery of Faith
* The Breaking of the Bread
* Sacrament of Reconciliation

### Special Preparation outside the Atrium

This preparation of the child may be designed to accommodate the needs and tradition of the community.

1. The Decision
  * The possibility of making a first communion is discussed gently in the context of eschatological presentations during the fall of the child's second year in the 6-9 atrium. It can be introduced within the context of the History of the Gifts presentation. "This year He will call even more people to his banquet that never ends! In the spring some children will make a very important decision about this very thing." This gives the children plenty of time to think about their decision.
  * A parent meeting (or series of them) is held in the fall as well. Parents are given the theology of preparation for the sacraments of Eucharist and Reconciliation. Discussion should include:
    * The nature of covenant as gift and response
    * The biblical pattern of forgiveness and celebration of forgiveness in a meal (seen in Luke's "parables of mercy" Found Coin/Found Sheep)
    * God's continual invitation to enjoy relationship with Him
    * The association between Baptism and Reconciliation as seen in the gestures
    * How reconciliation renews our fullness of life in the Spirit
    * The meaning of the symbol of the white garment which the children will be vested in after Reconciliation
    * The nature of the retreat
    * How to look for signs of readiness for the sacraments in their children
  * Parents could be given a handout with the overview of the preparation information along with a white garment pattern and a calendar for when and where the children will meet. Include in this handout suggestions about avoiding photography during the celebration and that any communion gifts be given at another time after the children have returned home. The greatest gift that they will receive this day is the gift of Eucharist.
2. The Mass of Intention
  * Usually held in January or February
  * The children prepare a Mass which may be celebrated in the atrium. Each child will have a part in the Mass. They should choose songs and readings.
  * During the Mass, children who have decided that they want to prepare for the sacraments this year place their names on the altar as a sign of their desire to prepare. At this time, it is explained to the children that there is still much preparation to do to ready themselves for this gift.
3. Interviews
  * Each child who has places his/her name on the altar is interviewed either individually or in small groups by the catechists and the priest, if possible. Possible questions to discuss in these interviews include:
    * How have we experienced God in our lives?
    * How else could we be experiencing the light and life of God?
    * What do we know about the bread and wine at Eucharist?
    * Is it just bread and wine?
    * In every decision we make we can ask people to help us: parents, catechists, priests, and especially our Good Shepherd. How do we speak with anyone? We talk and we listen. Is there some time in your day devoted to talking with and listening to God?
  * Then a mutual decision is made about a child's readiness to go forward.
4. The Mass of Enrollment
  * Usually in February or March, after a firm decision has been made, the priest reads out the name of each candidate during the celebration of the Mass and solemnly presents each child with a large print of the New American New Testament which they will bring to all the mediations and the retreat. In Rome, this Mass is done in the atrium.
  * Sometimes at this time the child is also given a prayer partner, chosen by the child. Their names can be inscribed along with the child's in a special book. This person can also help them to put on their white garment during the Liturgy of the Light celebration after First Confession.
5. The Meditations
  * Held on five separate occasions apart from the atrium, in a quiet, reflective space perhaps near a chapel. These are strictly mediation; no work is done. They last about two hours. Parents are invited to stay or may have separate sessions for the parents given at the same time. The parents should be seated somewhat behind the children so that the children are not very aware of their parents' presence.
  * Each session might begin with a time of communal prayer in a chapel. As they enter the chapel, they dip their hands into the water font to remind them of their baptism. Then they could enjoy prayer and song together, perhaps structured according to a brief, modified Liturgy of the Hours. Then the prayer will lead into a procession to the room where the meditations take place.
  * The Five Meditations revolve around the following:
    * True Vine I - John 15:1-11: "Remain in me!..." Emphasis is on the relationship between the vine and the branches, how each branch is born into the vine and the life giving sap that runs through it.
    * True Vine II - John 15:1-11: "...and you will bear much fruit." New emphasis is on the Vinedresser and the bearing of fruit. Using the imagery of the parable, sin is introduced as a "block" to the flow of sap within the vine. The joy of bearing fruit gives glory to the Vinedresser.
    * The Twin Parables of Mercy: The Found Sheep / The Found Coin - Luke 15:1-10: The freely given gift of God's mercy and forgiveness is an occasion of celebration and rejoicing as seen in these two parables.
    * The Forgiving Father - Luke 15:11-24: The father and the prodigal son celebrate with a banquet! What matter most is that the son returned.
    * The Centurion's Servant - Matthew 8:5-13: We come to the banquet not because we are worthy but because the Good Shepherd calls us. It is sheer gift. "Happy are those who are called to his supper."
6. The Retreat
  * Just before the sacraments are celebrated, the children enter into a retreat, usually lasting three or four days including the sacramental celebrations. It is primarily a time to quiet and deepen their reflection on the work that they have already come to know. No new materials are presented.
  * The retreat should be held at a special place prepared for this new step in their faith journey. It should be separate from the atrium with both inside and outside space available to the children and a special chapel area. The interior space should contain selected works from the atrium especially related to the sacraments.
  * The retreat should last each day from around 9 a.m. to 6:30 or 7:30 p.m. so that the children can share their evening meal together. There is no pressure: no rigid schedule. Parents will prepare the snacks and meals during the retreat. The children are reminded that while they are working, others are working also and praying for them so that they will have everything they need to make this a special time.
  * Essential elements of the retreat include time for work, play, handwork, daily liturgy that the children prepare for, and also preparation for the celebrations of first confession, renewal of baptismal vows, and first communion.
  * On Saturday of the retreat, late in the afternoon, the children will celebrate the sacrament of reconciliation. Their parents and possibly prayer partners, come afterward to be part of the renewal of baptism promises and the vesting with the white garment.
  * On Sunday morning, the children make their first communions dressed in their white garments. After the Eucharist, the children return to the retreat for continued quiet and enjoyment of the gift. They will be presented to the parish community the following Sunday.
