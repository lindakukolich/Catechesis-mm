### St. Anne’s - in- the- Fields Episcopal Church
### *Address phone*



Dear Parents of a child in Mustard Seed and True Vine Atrium,

Frequently parents ask me questions about their child’s participation in the Eucharist. When should a child begin to receive communion? What kind of explanation should they give? What is my child learning about Holy Communion in atrium?  As most of you know, in the Episcopal Church everyone, children included are welcome to participate in the sacrament of Holy Eucharist beginning at Baptism. While that opportunity makes sense theologically and pastorally it doesn’t address all the practical issues involved in the participation of children.  Much is left up to the church and the family and the work we do in Christian Formation following baptism.

The method of Christian Formation we use at St. Anne’s, The Catechesis of the Good Shepherd, (CGS) is very Eucharistic. In fact, everything in CGS comes either from the Bible or the liturgy.  From the very beginning of Level I, when the children learn to set up the model altar, through Level III the children are constantly being introduced to material, which helps then become active participants in the weekly celebration of the Eucharistic

In addition to this there is also a special opportunity offered to the Level II age children (age 6 and up) to deepen their understanding and participation in Holy Communion. This opportunity is called  “The Solemn Celebration of Holy Eucharist.”  The “Solemn Celebration “ involves four elements:

* I. Four Biblical Meditations for the children  
* II. Four Biblical Meditations for parents
* III. A Retreat, which includes Reconciliation, and Renewal of the Baptismal Covenant
* IV. Solemn Celebration Sunday.

All children who are in Level II are eligible and encouraged to participate as a way of deepening their participation and enjoyment of Holy Eucharist. Children may participate at any time during their three years in Level II. No child is ever required to participate in order to take communion. This is an enrichment opportunity not a “First Communion” program. However, if your child is this age and has not yet begun to receive Communion the “Solemn Celebration” is an ideal preparation.

While this unit is ideally done outside of the regular atrium time, we have chosen to make the mediations available to adults in our Education Hour and to all the Level II children in the atrium on Sunday s in Lent.  These meditations will take place as follows:

Sunday Meditations for Parents and Children

* March 1- True Vine I (A short service of blessing with parents and children precedes this meditation)
* March 8 - True Vine II
* March 15- The Found Coin
* March 22 -The Forgiving Father

The same meditations are being offered to the children and adults simultaneously with the intention that this will foster a discussion between you at home, in the car, during the week.

The Retreat will be held Saturday, March 28 from mid- morning until about 6 pm.  It will conclude with a potluck supper and a brief service of Baptismal Reaffirmation for parents and children in the church. Siblings, godparents and friends are invited. The retreat is a fun day for the children with crafts, singing reflection, bread making, writing prayers and celebrating their unity with God and one another. During the retreat children will prepare for their special participation in the Eucharistic Celebration the next day, March 29.

Children who are participating in this unit must; have a parent, godparent or special family friend at all of the meditations, be present in the atrium for all the meditations, and attend the retreat.

A brief meeting will follow the 10:30 service on Feb 8th in the Library. If you are planning to participate, please attend this meeting. We will answer questions and flesh out the Solemn Celebration unit more fully at that time.  We will also be looking for your help and participation as we offer this opportunity to you and you child.

We encourage you to speak with your child about this opportunity

If you have a special concern or question please e-mail me at *leader email* or speak with *Other leaders*.


Yours in the Service of the Good Shepherd
