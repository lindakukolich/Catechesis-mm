* To discuss the purpose of sap.
* To discuss what is a Vinedresser and what his job is.
* To ponder on the word “remain”.
* To introduce concepts of moral formation.
* To ponder the connection between our moral formation and our relationship with God and others.

**PRESENTATION:**

1. Introduction
    * There are a number of ways to talk about who Jesus is- names that describe Jesus. What are some names we know that describe who Jesus is? *Draw them out of children. (Good Shepherd, King...)*
    * Jesus has given us another way to think about who he is. Another name. He said: “I am the true vine.”
    * Think first, what do we know about vines? (Long, tangled have sap, hard to break, alive, bear fruit...)
    * Let’s listen to Jesus words as he describes himself. Listen to hear the other parts of the vine he describes.
2. Light Candle and read Scripture booklet of John 15: 1-8
    * Jesus didn’t just say I am a regular, or ordinary vine did he? He said: **I am the.... true vine.**
    * True. What does true mean? (real, original authentic, source, like good shepherd ... )
    * We heard about the vine, and also about the branches. What about the branches? Is it easy to see what is vine and what is a branch? *No.*
    * In the parable of the Good Shepherd Jesus gave us a way of thinking about us and him. About our relationship. We think of him as Shepherd and us as the sheep. How are this parable or the vine and branches different? *(Sheep and shepherd are separable. Vine and branches are inseparable.)*
    * When Jesus says, “I am the true vine and you are the branches,” what is he saying? *(We are inseparably linked- part of each other.)*
    * Let’s wonder about the sap. Where is the sap? What does the sap do for the plant? *(Flows through the plant, keeps it alive, nourishes it...)*
    * There is something else we might wonder about in what Jesus says about the sap. What is the sap in the true vine? *(Holy Spirit, friendship, relationship, communion...)* There might be a number of names for what this is.  I wonder if you can you think of some?
    * There are other characters in Jesus parable about the true vine. Who else is here? *The Vinedresser.*
    * What is a vinedresser?  *A gardener.*
    * What does a gardener do? *Takes care of the plants so they will grow.*
    * The vine dresser does many things to help the vine grow. *( Note; meaning of Hairdresser and Vine dresser are close. Both work to make the item beautiful and healthy even if this means trimming. )*
    * Who might this vinedresser be? *(God)*
    * The vinedresser wants the plants to grow and flourish. When a vine is healthy what does it produce? *Fruit.*
    * Fruit is the natural result of a well tended plant. What the gardener wants is grapes from the grapevine. Pumpkins from the pumpkin vine & etc.
    * **Jesus is the vine...God is the vinedresser... We are the branches..**
    * What might be the fruit?  Think about beautiful fruit on a plant. People admire it. It is beautiful. It gives glory to the gardener doesn’t it? Fruit in our lives gives glory to...? The fruit of our lives is? *( Good things we do. Who we are. Virtue)*
    * None of this is available without the vine. So Jesus gives the word: **Remain.**
    * Listen to that word. Hear it and hold it inside. Jesus says it to you. **Remain in me.**
    * Do you hear it?
    * How would you describe what remain means? *( Stay. Dwell. Live there. Be in.)*
    * What did we say the vinedresser’s choice is? If the branch bears fruit it remains. If it remains that is the only way it can bear fruit. This is how much Jesus wants us to be close to him- as close as the branches are to the vine.
    * We are the ones Jesus says these words to. **“Remain in me and I in you. I am the vine you are the branches.”** What helps us remain in Jesus?
    * How can we be beautiful vines for Jesus?
    * Let’s take a moment to reflect on Jesus’ invitation to remain. How does that make you feel?

3. **Invite response:**
You may want to tell Jesus how you feel. Could be privately or out loud.
*(Silence)*

4. **Concluding sentence:**
*One of*
    * Jesus invites us to remain in him.
    * “Remain in me and I in you. I am the vine you are the branches.”
    * Reread Scripture booklet to end meditation.

5. **Invite response in prayer, silence or songs:** “You are the vine” or “Thy Word is a Lamp Unto My Feet” SOL  17 & 15 or other communion songs from SOJ
