## Doctrinal Content:

* Jesus (the vine) invites us into a relationship with God (the vinedresser); this relationship is often blocked by sin.
* Our relationship with God is a living, growing relationship.  To remain healthy, we must maintain close contact.
* When we lose contact / relationship with Jesus we “wither” and cannot “bear fruit.”
* The sacrament of reconciliation restores our right relationship with God.
* When we receive the Eucharist we receive the renewing strength of Christ, empowering us to bear fruit, bringing glory to God.

## Direct Aim:

* To nurture in the child the desire to have a relationship with God.
* To announce that our relationship with God can be damaged by sin.
* To explore ways to remove sin (reconciliation).

## Indirect Aims:

* To define and identify sin.
* To realize that all we need for our relationship with God is the desire to be connected with Him.
* To prepare for Solemn Holy Communion.
* To further explore the images of Jesus as the vine, us as the branches, God as the vinedresser, fruit as our gifts / moral lives.
* To connect these images to the sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist.
* To encourage self-examination and promote moral formation.
* To prepare for First Communion or the solemn celebration of Eucharist; to encourage greater participation in the Eucharist.

## Materials:

* Bible and/or Scripture booklet
* Potted vine
* 4 Candles with the 1st and 2nd lighted, snuffer, matches
* Table with cloth
* Optional instead of candle – candelabra with place for candles for each meditation (four).
* Optional picture of grape vine

## Presentation:

1.  Gather the children and recall True Vine I.
  	* Last week we heard the words of Jesus “I am the vine, you are the branches”.
	  * Let us recall some of what Jesus said to us.  What are some of the words he used?  (*Vine, prune, fruit, sap, etc.*)
	  * How are the vine and the branches connected? (*sap*)
		* What helps the branches bear fruit?
	  * What can we say about the sap?  (*It feeds us, extends to the end of the vine.*)
	  * What happens if the sap doesn’t reach the branches?  (*They die.*)
	  * Will the sap in the True Vine ever dry up?  (*No – the True Vine is Jesus.*)
  	* I wonder who the branches are?
	  * What helps us remain connected to the vine?  *(Accept the sap, be open to God’s love.)*
	  * How big is the true vine?
	  * Who, more than any of us, wants the vine to flourish?

2.	Light two candles and read the Scripture (John 15:1-8).
	* Let us think about the branches that may not be healthy – why would that be? (Broken, too far from source, sap blocked.)
	* In the true vine there can also be blocks in the branches. What does the block do? *Thwarts- stops the flow of life to the fruit.*
	* What would it be like if the block were removed?
	* In the True Vine there can be blocks that keep the flow of life from getting to the fruit.  What do you think these blocks might be? *If possible let them name this themselves.* There is a name for this block – **sin**.
	* Can the vine remove its own blocks?  (No - need the vinedresser.)
	* Can we remove our own blocks?
	* The Divine dresser has given us a way to remove the blocks – reconciliation (a celebration of love, mercy, and forgiveness.)
	* Let us think about blocks and how they can be removed, and opportunities to celebrate reconciliation.
	* What is it like for other branches if there is illness, or differences in the group (vine)?
	*  Later we will have more time to think about reconciliation.  We will have time to think about the blocks that might be in the branch and how they can be removed. We will also think about the work the Holy Spirit does to remove the blocks and to fill us again with the spirit- the good sap. *(Depending on the circumstances you may also want to include the following.)* We will also have time to talk about the opportunities we have to celebrate reconciliation, either together with the whole congregation on Sundays, or individually with the priest who sits with us as Jesus.
3.  Read Scripture again, followed by silence.
4. Invite songs and prayer
	* Sing “I am the Vine”

## Work of the Child:

* Create original art.
* Copy the Scripture
* Compose a prayer
* Leaf polishing
* Using stencil, print a vine with leaves.
