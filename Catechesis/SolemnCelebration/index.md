As members of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, we acknowledge that all are welcome at God's table. That is, there is no special set of pre-requisites for receiving Communion, though if you are receiving, you are strongly encouraged to be baptized. As a result, these sacramental preparation presentations are not a requirement before a first communion. We have found, however, that they help us understand our connection with God, how much God yearns to be close to us, and how much joy there is when we recognize the parts of our lives that block love in our lives, and ask God to remove those blocks.

This is a series of five presentations, often given during Lent, culminating in a special service including the Individual Rite of Reconciliation and a celebration of the Eucharist. While it is recommended that we give this series starting with seven year old children, we have found that their understanding is deeper when we wait till they are nine or ten.

## The Presentations:

* [True Vine I](TrueVineI) - John 15:1-8, focused on fruit and remain
* [True Vine II](TrueVineII) - John 15:1-8, focused on vinedresser
* [Synthesis of Found Coin and Found Sheep](FoundCoinSheep) - Luke 15:8-10 and 4-6, usually called the Lost Coin and Lost Sheep, but focused on joy in finding instead of peril of being lost
* [The Forgiving Father](ForgivingFather) - Luke 15:11-24 - The Prodigal Son, but focused  on the joy of the Father on the son's return
* The Rite of Reconciliation

## Extra Materials

* Looking at my branch
* Candles
* Shawls
* [The Rome model](RomeModel) - Sacramental Preparation as practiced in Sofia's Atrium in Rome, starting with work done in the 3-6 Atrium

## Pre-requisites

It is helpful to set the stage for the Solemn Celebration to do these presentations in the Fall, assuming the Solemn Celebration meditations will be given in the late winter, that is during Lent.
