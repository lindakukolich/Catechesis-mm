Catechesis of the Good Shepherd is a Montessori based program of Christian formation. Developed in Rome by Sofia Cavalletti and others, it is used around the world. In the United States, the Catechesis is used by many denominations, including Catholic, Episcopal, Methodist, and Greek Orthodox.

As a trained catechist who has worked with children since around 2000, I am sharing simplified versions of my album pages here. Album pages are like lesson plans for the work we do with children. This is partly so I have better access to these documents from within other online environments where I work with other catechists.

Collections of Album Pages:

* [Solemn Celebration](SolemnCelebration)
  * Meditations on Reconciliation used in preparation for a Solemn celebration of the Eucharist. For some congregations, this is a necessary part of preparation to receive communion. For others, it is an opportunity to deepen our understanding of confession and forgiveness.
* The Good Shepherd Atrium - Level I - Ages 3-6
* The True Vine Atrium - Level II - Ages 6-9
* [Level III - Ages 9-12](Atrium3)
