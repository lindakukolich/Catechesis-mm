I need a place to host my album pages for presentations for my Level II Atrium. One place I already have access to is my Github account, via it github.io interface and gh-pages branch. Fine. The problem is, plain vanilla pages are boring, and the manuals tend to be a list of features, rather than a list of reasons why I care.

Enter minimal-mistakes, a system for page layout that quietly gives you an example of plenty of the features of a github hosted web-site. I am currently trying to get the base site in place. Then I can add actual content.

I have made a few album pages using markdown, a format that works for me, though realistically not a lot of other Catechists will be familiar with it. Still, I want something that can be formatted and still stored as source code not binary. Everyone else uses DOC files which is a fail.
