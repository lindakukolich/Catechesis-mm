I've been practicing my calligraphy for a week, trying to get my Blackletter good enough to be able to write the 17 maxims necessary for the Level III Atrium. These texts are written on parchment paper and then pasted to wooden panels in the shape of Commandment tablets. We have the texts, but they are framed and inconvenient to use. We use them anyway, but it is hard to store all the frames. I used my budget for the year on a Maxim box plus tablets from [Shepherd's Closet](http://www.shop.shepherdscloset.net/). Fun fact, I only have the tablets for the Maxims. I still need to manufacture the larger tablets for the summary of the law.

After getting the tablets and figuring out how I want the to look, I went in my calligraphy and decoupage supplies. I found dip pens, waterproof ink, and advise at [Bob Slate's](http://www.bobslatestationer.com/). They also have the two sided felt tip calligraphy pens I did my practice work with. AND they have the Pilot Parallel's I am currently coveting. I got my mod podge at [Artist and Craftsman](https://www.artistcraftsman.com). There is a whole wall of it at AC Moore's but they aren't as much fun to visit.

All supplies in hand, I did a test. The water-soluble felt tips work fine with Mod Podge. The Higgins waterproof (Better use a dip pen. Make sure you clean your nibs. If you don't clean your nibs well enough, at least they were cheap!) made a gigantic smudge. The solvent for the Higgins smells like bleach. Do not leave the bottle open. It smells. the Mod Podge has an odor as well. So, I got a lovely shopping trip out of this, but I need to actually do the cheap easy thing instead of the fancy one. Sadly, the black *Calligraph Duo* pen has gone walk-about, so I need to get another one at Bob Slate.

After my unexpected result with the Higgins ink I tried a bunch of ball points and felt tips. The nice ones that tell you the number of mm's in the tip, and the gel ones that I end up using all the time for other stuff. They don't smear as badly as the Higgins. In general, felt tip is fine. Gel is less fine, waterproof dip ink is bad.
